# Cat-Dog Classfication Problem
The Cat-Dog Classification Problem is a standard computer vision problem to make classification between cat and dog.
# What  is Transfer Learning 
It is a technique used in area of artifical intellegence in which we use an already developed model as the starting point for a similar related task. In computer vision it is an popular technique to use pre-trained models to solve some similar related tasks.
Some famous models are
  - AlexNet
  - VGG
  - ResNet
  - SqueezeNet
  - DenseNet
  - Inception v3
  - GoogLeNet
  - ShuffleNet v2
  - MobileNet v2
  - ResNeXt
  - Wide ResNet
  - MNASNet
